angularjs-intro
===============
A quick intro into different Angular concepts

Will need [nodejs].org to run the webserver and for the main angular-phonecat tutorial (please see README.angular-phonecat.md for details)

1. Go to directory
2. Dependencies shouldn't be needed for just running the app but if they are get dependencies using ```npm install```
3. Run ```node scripts/web-server.js``` from the main directory to run a local webserver
4. http://localhost:8000/app/intro.html (port may change depending on your comupter. Check the console for exact)

Depends on the AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application: https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat/
(Also see README.angular-phonecat.md)
